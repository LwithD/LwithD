Maybe my code makes u feel I'm a spider-man hahahahahah.

Actually I'm working as a Backend Developer. And I'm learning machine-learning and data analysis. I'll share part of my project during my learning.

What I most need is a chance to work with experienced and knowledgeable computer scientist.

Hope my code helps. And touch me at lwithd@qq.com.
